            <h1 class="Unity-Title">What is Unity</h1>
                <p>Unity is a good start to making games if you have never made games before. 
                    The platform may seem a bit scary at first, but once you learn the basics 
                    then it becomes more fun and entertaining to use! Unity can support both 
                    2D and 3D games, so you are able to experiment with whatever you enjoy making! 
                    Now you can get a lot done without code in Unity, but the program uses C# for 
                    its coding language, and it is one code language that is user-friendly and can 
                    be easily used and learned. Now unity compared to other game engines can be a 
                    bit small and limiting so smaller games or mobile games would work more efficiently 
                    with this program.</p>

            <h1 class="Unreal-Engine-Title">What is Unreal Engine</h1>
                <p>Unreal Engine is basically like unity but with multiple upgrades in different areas. 
                    This game engine is more complex and better for ones who have little to a lot of 
                    experience with game development. But that does not mean that it is the better option 
                    when you are more experienced. Unreal Engine strives with big game titles because it 
                    can develop them very well! Unreal uses C++ for its coding language and can be a little 
                    more difficult on learning in general. With Unreal Engine, it is good at making game worlds 
                    look amazing. It is the game engine that is more ideal for bigger sized games that have the 
                    potential to be added to platforms like PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo Switch.</p>
