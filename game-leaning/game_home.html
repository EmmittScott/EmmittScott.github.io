            <p>Video Game Design, to put it simply, is the process of making video games on all kinds 
                of devices! They usually create game ideas, build code, and test software to see if it 
                works. These people work on the characters, story points, gameplay mechanics, settings, 
                and so much more! Some of the key elements that a Video Game Designer needs are to have 
                creativity, time management, problem-solving, and online technical skills. All these 
                things are necessary because they are the specific skills that surround a 
                Video Game Designer.</p>

            <h1 class="Engine-Title">Where to Start</h1>
            <p>One of the best ways to start with Video Game Design is to just start making video games 
                and start experimenting with different programs and platforms! Most video games are based 
                on something called a Game Engine, which is a platform that is the basic software for a video 
                game. Two of the most used game engines are either Unity or Unreal engine. And both can be good 
                starting points for new game developers. </p>
